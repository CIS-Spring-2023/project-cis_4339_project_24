# Instructions for setup and running application as a local instance.

Upon cloning the repository to your local computer, create two new terminal windows to work with the
frontend and backend instances spearately. Then follow the commands below on their own terminal windows
to run the application as a local instance. Also listed below are the user login credentials once you 
successfully run the application. Additional documentation can be found in the README.md files of the
frontend and backend folders.

Log in Credentials:
- Editor role:
    - username: user1
    - password: password1

- Viewer role:
    - username: user2
    - password: password2

## Backend Terminal
```
cd backend

npm install

npm start
```

## Frontend Terminal
```
cd frontend

npm install

npm run dev
```

If for any reason the application does not render or function properly please run the following commands 
on their respective terminal windows and attempt to run the application again (and/or restart application as needed).

## Backend Terminal
```

npm install bycrypt
```

## Frontend Terminal

npm install pinia

npm install bootstrap
